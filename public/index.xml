      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>The multi-level regression with post-stratification (MRP) was founded by Lauren Kennedy to establish a community around those interested in MRP.
We host a weekly(ish) online meeting via Zoom where we discuss a paper or technique broadly related to MRP. We welcome anyone who is interested - you don&amp;rsquo;t need experience with MRP, enthusiasm is enough.
Please take a moment to look at our upcoming schedule and we&amp;rsquo;d love to have you take part.</description>

      <description>We meet via Zoom and we welcome everyone.
You do not need experience with MRP, statistics, or anything else in particular. The nice thing about MRP is that it requires a whole bunch of skills and our talks reflect that. We have everyone from tenured professors to undergraduates.
