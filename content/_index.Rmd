# Welcome!

The multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP) was founded by [Lauren Kennedy](https://jazzystats.com/) in 2019 to establish a community around those interested in MRP.

We host a weekly online meeting via Zoom where we discuss a paper or technique broadly related to MRP. We welcome anyone who is interested - you don't need experience with MRP, enthusiasm is enough.

Please take a moment to look at our upcoming schedule and we'd love to have you take part.

Co-organisers: [Lauren Kennedy](https://jazzystats.com/) (Monash University) and [Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com) (University of Toronto).
