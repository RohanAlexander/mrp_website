<p>The multi-level regression with post-stratification (MRP) was founded by <a href="https://jazzystats.com/">Lauren Kennedy</a> to establish a community around those interested in MRP.</p>
<p>We host a weekly(ish) online meeting via Zoom where we discuss a paper or technique broadly related to MRP. We welcome anyone who is interested - you don’t need experience with MRP, enthusiasm is enough.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to look at our upcoming schedule and we’d love to have you take part.</p>
<p>Co-organisers: <a href="https://jazzystats.com/">Lauren Kennedy</a> (Monash University) and <a href="https://rohanalexander.com">Rohan Alexander</a> (University of Toronto).</p>
