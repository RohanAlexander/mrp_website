<h1>Participate</h1>
<p>We meet via Zoom and we welcome everyone.</p>
<p>You do not need experience with MRP, statistics, or anything else in particular. The nice thing about MRP is that it requires a whole bunch of skills and our talks reflect that. We have everyone from tenured professors to undergraduates.</p>
<p>If you would like to join the mailing list to receive invitations please email <a href="mailto:lauren.kennedy729@gmail.com">Lauren</a> and <a href="mailto:rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca">Rohan</a>.</p>
