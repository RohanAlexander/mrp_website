We meet via Zoom and we welcome everyone. 

You do not need experience with MRP, statistics, or anything else in particular. The nice thing about MRP is that it requires a whole bunch of skills and our talks reflect that. We have everyone from tenured professors to undergraduates.

If you would like to join the mailing list to receive invitations please email [Lauren](mailto:lauren.kennedy729@gmail.com) and [Rohan](mailto:rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca).
